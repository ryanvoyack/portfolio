  - A paper I am in the process of publishing. In it, I solve for a novel [Posterior Predictive Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_predictive_distribution), devise a new theorem that defines a nice relationship between transformations of likelihood / prior pairs, and their corresponding posterior predictive destributions, and write a proof for that theorem.
